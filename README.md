# 📉 Customers Churn Prediction - ANN

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn in a telecom-like business scenario. The goal is to identify customers likely to stop using the service, allowing the company to take preemptive actions to retain them.

The project includes **data preprocessing**, **model building**, **training**, and **evaluation**, all built using **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in subscription-based businesses. Understanding which customers are likely to leave enables proactive customer retention strategies.

This ANN-based churn prediction system performs the following:

- 🚀 Loads and preprocesses structured customer data
- 🧽 Encodes categorical variables and scales numerical features
- 🧠 Builds and trains a deep neural network using Keras
- 📊 Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics
- 📝 Makes predictions on new or unseen customer records

## 🔍 Features Used

Some key features used in the dataset include:

- Customer demographics (gender, age)
- Account information (tenure, balance, number of products)
- Activity metrics (is_active_member, has_cr_card)
- Geography and credit score
